Commands to validate that Junos is doing RPKI:
# Shows RTR connections to validators
show validation session
 
# Shows stats of database copied over from validators
show validation statistics
 
# Shows what routes are invalid
show route validation-state invalid 
 
# shows the list of prefixes copied over from validators
show validation replication database

# This is Cloudflareâ€™s intentionally invalid prefix
show route 103.21.244.0/24
 
# Another Cloudflare prefix that should always be valid
show route 1.1.1.0/24
